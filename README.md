# BMM - Better Music Mode for Yeelight

It always irked me how bad the music mode that comes with the Yeelight app is, so this an attempt at making one that looks better by actually measuring and reacting to BPM. (Still in progress, things might break)

## Features:

- Beatdetection via Madmom (Currently varies a LOT)
- Add Spotify API Key to double-check current BPM
