# YeelightBMM - Better Music Mode

It always irked me how bad the music mode that comes with the Yeelight app is, so this is an attempt at making one that looks better by actually measuring and reacting to the BPM of the current playing song. (Still in progress, things might break)

Mostly coded by GPT-4

## Features:

- Beatdetection via Madmom (Currently varies a LOT)
- Add Spotify API Key to double-check current BPM
