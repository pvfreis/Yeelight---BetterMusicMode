# BMM - Better Music Mode for Yeelight

It always irked me how bad the music mode that comes with the Yeelight app is, so this an attempt at making one that looks better and actually measures and follows BPM.


## Features:

- Beatdetection via Madmom
- (TO-DO) Option to add Spotify API Key to double-check current BPM
